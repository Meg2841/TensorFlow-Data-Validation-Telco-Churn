# TensorFlow Data Validation – Telco Customer Churn

This project is an extended version of a TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) lab.  
The original lab demonstrates how to use TFDV on a dataset.  
This version adds a second case study using the Telco Customer Churn dataset and a few extra utilities.

The goal is to show how TFDV can be used to explore, validate, and slice real-world data in a way that is closer to production workflows.
